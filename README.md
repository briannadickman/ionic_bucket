## Bucket App - version 2.0 - built with Ionic 3 and Firebase 2

This is a revision of my previous MEAN stack Bucket App, utlizing Ionic 3 as the front-end and Firebase 2 as the back-end. 

The application started using the Tabs template from [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/) and has been built out to simulate version 1 of Bucket App.
